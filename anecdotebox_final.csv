A week ago, the recreation committee at our office sent an email inviting us to celebrate with a potluck. Surprisingly, the word ‘Potluck’ baffled me, but to avoid feeling demotivated, I cleverly attributed my vocabulary weakness to my Marathi medium school background. What surprised me was my Boss—despite her schooling in a convent school, she also struggled to understand the term. Luckily, this unexpected discovery swiftly dispelled my self-doubt and promptly changed my perception of vocabulary skills in local vs. English medium schools. Anyway, for the past couple of days, I have been extending a helping hand to my wife by preparing the tiffin for my school-going daughter. This is because the ladies in our society, including my wife, participate in intense yoga practice at the Yoga Centre. They are preparing to Showcase their precision performance for the upcoming local event on International Yoga Day — a grand award-winning event organised by our local Mayor. As I was about to enter the Kitchen for preparation, my wife informed me that she had already kept the idli-dosa batter and garnished coconut in the freezer. Though my original plan was to make dosa, but my wife suggested uttapam instead because dosa would turn into uttapam in the tiffin box. She also mentioned that I could prepare the same dish for my daughter’s tiffin and the office party if I wished. I thanked her for her ingenious high-paid corporate management approach— achieving two goals in one stroke, even though she was a homemaker. When I asked how many portions for my daughter’s tiffin, she replied, “Two medium-sized portions.” And left for her yoga class with a yoga mat. ing my wife’s suggestion, I made two uttapams for my daughter’s school tiffin and four for my office party. While my daughter was packing her school bag, she asked about the number of uttapams (a South Indian snack) I had made for her. I mentioned two, but she insisted on having four. When I asked for the reason, she explained that she had already informed her mother the previous night. She told me that her friend Sonu’s mother was unwell, and since Sonu’s father does not know cooking, they had planned to share my daughter’s tiffin for the day. I felt a sense of superiority, knowing that culinary skills are very hard to come and not for everyone. But worried about the Vegaflation, particularly the skyrocketing tomaflation, I called my wife to give her a dose for offering free catering services. After a long ring, someone answered the call in a slow tone, “Sir, Madamji is currently in the Sirsasana position (an inverted yoga posture where the head goes down and the legs go up).” The voice asked if there was anything urgent, and I replied, “Nothing urgent,” before disconnecting the call. “Papa, Sonu’s brother, also studies in her school in the 3rd standard. What will he eat? Even though Sonu hasn’t explicitly mentioned it, her brother might join us for sharing tiffin, so it would be better to take two more for him.” Okay, now it’s time to start. I will drop my daughter off at the school bus stop and then catch my office bus. As we are about to step out of the house. My daughter surprised me with new information. She said, “Papa, Sonu’s brother, also studies in her school in the 3rd standard. What will he eat? Even though Sonu hasn’t explicitly mentioned it, her brother might join us for sharing tiffin, so it would be better to take two more for him.” Frustrated, I replied, “But then there won’t be anything left for me to take to the office party.” At that moment, my inner irritation was on the verge of manifesting, making my daughter the first victim. But fortunately, my daily dose of meditation proved to be an effective saviour. I paused for a moment to reflect on whether my share of home-cooked Uttapam should go to the office potluck party or my daughter’s school potluck. Then I realised, anyway, how does it matter? After all, a potluck is a potluck. Thank you. Daane daane pe likha hai khane wale ka naam (every grain bears the name of person who partakes) Happy dining!",https://anecdotebox.com/the-potluck/,745

Every home proudly displays the national flag. This year’s Independence Day reminded me that patriotism often blooms in the smallest of moments. That morning, my 10-year-old daughter and I set out early, excited to attend the flag-hoisting ceremony at our old housing society, the place we had called home for more than two decades. We had moved recently, but the memories — and her childhood friends — still lived there. The car’s FM radio was playing soft patriotic songs, and outside, the city was dressed for the occasion. Vendors stood at street corners, their carts piled high with flags and balloons in orange, white, and green. The air was alive with music, chatter, and that rare sense of collective pride. As we neared the venue, a vibrant scene on the left side of the road caught my eye – a group of school students gliding effortlessly on their skates, waving Indian flags in their hands. It was a wonderful sight. But in a split second, disaster struck: one student lost control and bumped into my car. I slammed on the brakes, stopping immediately. Thankfully, it wasn’t a serious accident. Although it was a very minor injury, assessing its intensity and ensuring everything was under control during those tense moments caused a delay of about 15 to 20 minutes. By the time we reached our venue, the flag hoisting ceremony had just finished. My daughter’s innocence face mirrored her disappointment. Though I tried to catch another ceremony at a nearby society, that also proved futile, leaving us both disheartened. She had been looking forward to seeing the flag raised and catching up with her old friends but nothing can be done now . I tried to reassure her, but it was clear she was still upset. As we drove home, the silence in the car spoke volume. My daughter stared out the window, her disappointment was palpable. I felt a pang of guilt—I had promised her this moment, and now it was gone. Then, as if a light had switched on in my mind, I remembered the national flag I had bought a couple of days ago for the “Har Ghar Tiranga” Campaign for our house, but I had completely forgotten. It was still in the car’s drawer. Without a second thought, I opened the drawer and took out the flag. In that moment, I realised this was the perfect chance to hoist the flag at our building gate. But it was just the two of us, my daughter and I. I thought it would be more meaningful if we could gather a few others. I searched our neighbours it they are in round but nobody was seen. I even tried to find people from nearby buildings, but no one was in sight. Then, I noticed our society’s security guard, who was busy washing cars. An idea struck me—why not include him in our flag hoisting? I called him over and had another thought: why not invite the security guards from the neighboring buildings as well? Our security guard quickly went and gathered them, and soon enough, four of them had joined us. Happy Independence Day Within minutes, four of them stood with us at the gate of our building. Someone pulled out a phone to play the national anthem. I handed our security guard the flag, and he raised it slowly, proudly. I looked at my daughter. Her eyes were shining now, her disappointment replaced by pride. And in that moment, I realised — patriotism isn’t only found in grand celebrations or large gatherings. Sometimes, it’s in the small acts we choose to create, and the pride we feel in our hearts. That day, our little ceremony felt as real and as meaningful as any grand event. It was a quiet tribute to the leaders and the countless unsung heroes who gave their everything so that we could stand here, free. A nation is not built by speeches alone — but by the everyday actions of its people, no matter how small. Thank You.

In our frantic, target-oriented, and perpetually busy world, doing nothing is not something we would consciously choose. However, if we do, daring to be idle even for a short period proves extremely tough. I’d been craving a break for days, but every time I tried, something came up. Remembering the blissful peace of the COVID lockdown days, I finally decided to dedicate a full day to complete idleness—a retreat to refresh both my mind and body. Surprisingly, despite brainstorming various ideas, I couldn’t figure out how to unwind for a whole day of doing nothing. So, I scaled back my ambition, settling for half a day. Anticipating unavoidable distractions at home, I planned to spend half a day at the nearby Lord Ganesha temple, simply sitting in a quiet corner. To ensure I wouldn’t be tempted by emails or social media, I left my “second better half”—my mobile phone—at home, of course unwillingly. Today is Sunday, my execution day of inaction. Fully prepared, I set off on my bike towards the temple. As I arrived , the soothing chants of the morning Aarti welcomed me. While the other devotees sought divine blessings for success and prosperity through their prayers, my mission was quite the opposite—a quest for blissful nothingness. I found a nice corner, got comfy, and just as I was settling in, the temple security guard announced they were about to wash the corridors. All vehicles had to be moved. As I take my bike outside, he dropped another bombshell: the temple will close in fifteen minutes for painting ahead of the upcoming Ganesh Puja celebration. What a setback! My meticulously planned “Niksen” session was now in jeopardy. Feeling pretty defeated, while driving home, I noticed the nearby library was just opening. “Why not give it a shot?” I thought, and walked in. But, just within 15 to 20 minutes, boredom began to set in. I couldn’t help but regret not having my second better half with me. Then, a man reading a newspaper caught my eye. Maybe this would alleviate my boredom, I thought. I seized the paper and eagerly turned to the first page, only to be jolted by a half-page advertisement in the lower corner. The Income Tax Department’s urgent reminder was clear: file your returns by tomorrow, the final deadline. It also warned against fake rumours, emphasising that no extensions would be granted. To my dismay, I had forgotten to file my income tax return. This oversight had completely slipped my mind! As lunchtime neared and everything seemed normal, a stark red email flashed across my laptop screen, warning of an immediate system shutdown due to a catastrophic software virus. Chaos erupted as everyone scrambled to save their work and power down their computers. It felt reminiscent of COVID lockdown, except this time the virus was spreading to the digital world. Overwhelmed with panic , I could no longer stay put and rushed home to file my tax return, and just made it on time. It was around 10 AM on Monday morning, and I arrived at the office feeling subdued, regretting yesterday’s misadventure, but as usual, got on with work. As lunchtime neared and everything seemed normal, a stark red email flashed across my laptop screen, warning of an immediate system shutdown due to a catastrophic software virus. Chaos erupted as everyone scrambled to save their work and power down their computers. It felt reminiscent of COVID lockdown, except this time the virus was spreading to the digital world. Being paranoid and clouded with crazy thoughts, I even Imagined if this virus could leap from the screen and infect humans. With the entire network down, our canteen TV became the sole source of external information. It soon became clear that it was a massive global technology outage caused by a faulty software update, disrupting all the sectors all over the world. However, When the TV flashed news of airline systems crashing, showing nightmares for passengers at the airport, my anxiety aggravated. Since our office building was directly in the landing path for all planes approaching Mumbai airport, I worried that planes might fall from the sky. I rushed to the canteen’s wide glass windows, nervously looking at the sky for any signs of planes falling. Fortunately, the sky was clear—what a great relief! With no quick fix in sight for this widespread tech disaster, our management eventually declared a company holiday. While all my colleagues prepared to leave the office, I also decided to pack my laptop bag to leave for home. Just as I reached the office exit door and was about to swipe my access card, the idea of ” Niksen” suddenly came to mind. Why not use this unexpected downtime to resume my ” Niksen ” experiment? With no distractions and technology silenced, I returned to my cabin, ready to embrace idleness once more. Thank you. So, let’s all embrace a bit of Niksen in our lives for some much-needed mental and physical refreshment. Just remember, while intentional idleness is fantastic, too much of it might lead to procrastination. Enjoy your reading!

It all started with a workplace email: “Happy Men’s Day celebration. All employees are","inspirational, reflective, emotional, nostalgic, philosophical","Some moments in life do not fit inside photo frames. But when memory becomes the only archive, real magic begins. It all started with a workplace email: “Happy Men’s Day celebration. All employees are requested to bring a childhood photo and write a message to their child-self. A simple request. Nothing unusual. But I knew I would struggle to find one. I tried anyway. Called home. Asked my mother if she remembers if any old school or college photos were lying somewhere. Asked my siblings if they could check any old boxes. I even went through my old files — the certificates and papers I carried with me when I moved to a new city 30 years ago. But nothing. No childhood photo at all. For a moment, it felt strange — almost uncomfortable — not having any photos from those years. And then it struck me: I didn’t need a photo to prove anything. The child within me had never left — still alive, still present. And now, five decades later, the best message I can offer my child-self is not advice, not a lecture, not a warning — just a gentle truth whispered across time. Dear my child-self, Let me tell you what happened. First, you should know this — your playfulness and curiosity are still here with me. The shyness is mostly gone, but the silliness never did; it still shows up particularly when I try too hard to be an “adult.” Life didn’t turn out the way you imagined. Remember those school days when you were a good football player? Then, when India lifted the Cricket World Cup first time, the world seemed to shift overnight. Suddenly, every boy in every lane became a “batsman.” Football quietly faded and you simply flowed with the tide. Then, came the high school Board exams — the first time life measured you with a number. You passed in the second division. And with a single result, father’s quiet dream of seeing his son studying science and becoming an engineer faded away. A government college wouldn’t take you. A private college was impossible — your siblings were studying, and the family’s finances had already stretched thin. And then, a door you never noticed quietly opened. Commerce. A subject no one in our circle talked about. A path no one recommended. But that was the road that welcomed you. You took it — not out of passion, but practicality. Lower middle-class survival is built on practical choices. You studied. You graduated. And then life delivered its biggest blow. We lost our father. Dreams stepped aside. Survival stepped forward. The path to higher studies closed, leaving law as the only door still open. So instead of becoming an engineering graduate, you became a law graduate. This is how life works: the dreams we chase fade, and the ones we never consider become ours. Instead… you moved to Mumbai — that faraway planet you’d only seen in films. A place where people walked fast and didn’t look back. Where trains had their own attitude. Where life didn’t stop for anyone. You live there now. And that childhood wish of sitting in an aeroplane once? Well… now you fly so often that it no longer feels like a dream to be fulfilled. Back home, and your friends, everyone found their own path. All your siblings are doing well. Mother is still with us. And our small house was rebuilt. Bigger, brighter, with proper rooms. Perhaps this is where your dreams finally found their way. Your school friends also drifted into their own worlds. And there’s something you should know with a heavy heart: your best friend, Rajan, is no more. The world changed faster than any of us imagined. Today’s kids aren’t the way we were. They call themselves Gen Z — born into possibilities we couldn’t even imagine. Remember that calculator your rich friend once brought to school? That evolved into a mobile phone. And that mobile phone evolved into a world. Children don’t play outside anymore. They play inside screens. Friends don’t come home after school; they come online. Arguments, gossip, relationships — everything happens on devices thinner than your old compass box. And now the same device has become the camera and the photo album. But hardly anyone takes photo prints. And somewhere through all these changing times, you found yourself becoming a father of two. And life quietly moved in directions you never imagined. Some dreams broke. Some changed shape. Some arrived without announcement. And some — the most important ones — found you when you weren’t even looking. Through all of this, I’m grateful you stayed in me — curious, playful, foolish, hopeful. It’s not that I outgrew you. I grew with you. And one last thing before I stop: though I couldn’t preserve you in a photo, don’t you think that what lives in the mind and body is often more vivid, more alive, more real than any photograph could ever be? Let’s keep this journey going , together. Happy Men’s Day. P.S. Dear reader — Be an adult but never lose the child in you. Thank You.

A day before January 26, late in the evening, I received a phone call from the Secretary of our old housing Society, where I lived for 25 years. I felt deeply grateful when he invited me to attend the Society’s Republic Day celebration. I am getting ready to attend my old society’s flag hosting ceremony. This is a perfect occasion to wear an elegant white kurta, but not having a white kurta, thought to wear at least a white shirt. I could find one but that was our company gifted, bearing a company brand logo. The Nagar Sevak of that locality graced the Society’s Republic Day event. After hoisting of the national flag and a heartfelt rendition of the national anthem, I had the chance to catch up with the Nagar Sevak, secretary, and our old neighbors, remembering about the good old days. In cosmopolitan urban life, we barely talk to our neighbors and members of society, or to the local people. The doors of city houses are always in a shutting position. As a result, when our neighbor opens, we are closed and when we open; they are closed. Though, in crisis, our neighbors, local community, and society people are our instant help. On my way back to home, I suddenly realized that I had yet to meet the Nagar Sevak from my present locality, so thought today is the right occasion to meet him and introduce myself. In the meantime, my mobile rang, a call from wife, she asked me to bring a packet of curd while coming. I said yes and disconnected. Once again, she called, to reconfirm that I bring Rs 50 Wala packet, not Rs 25 Wala. With a great passion, I parked my bike and walked into the nearby venue in the garden. However, when entered inside, found that the flag hoisting and national anthem singing is already over, people are all over the garden, and a group of people have gathered around the Nagar Sevak in the corner, engaged in conversation. Though, I am ready but somehow feeling awkward and uneasy about how to approach someone who does not know me at all. I feel sudden drop in my excitement level and uncertain of what to do next. I am trying hard to regain my self-confidence and look forward to engaging in conversation with Nagar Sevak, but timid emotions are overflowing. Thought I could at least find someone in the crowd who knows me. But to my surprise, everyone here is a stranger to me. My Search is on. Luckily, found a known person standing with Nagar sevak. He owns a Kirana store, and sometimes I visit his store. Thought, I could meet Nagar Sevak through him. Though Fifteen minutes have passed; I am still standing alone while others are chitchatting and enjoying a companion and served snacks. Being trapped in my own mind, realized that trying to socialize in an unfamiliar setting is extremely difficult, easier said than done. The fact is, I am not getting the strength in the hours of greatest need. Again, the mobile rang, saw wife’s call, sent an auto message “I will call you back.”. My constant look at the owner of the Kirana store is still on and just an eye-to-eye contact is “a wow moment for me.” Received a notification alert, message from wife, her message, “I need curd not you call back.” It looks like the curd woe is emerging as a potential threat to spoil my pursuit. I think too much, analyzing lots of options, but really do nothing. My intelligence says I must break from thinking and go for action, but my shyness has already overpowered and obstructing me to move forward. Even gaining a little courage at that moment for me is tough. My feelings of isolation, frustration and nervousness are at their peak, causing a depletion of my psychological level and self-esteem. I am nearly forsaken. Sensing my failure, my mind asks, “why did you come here without knowing your competence of social skills?” Remember, when passion drives, mind takes the backseat. And when failure becomes imminent, the mind gets an opportunity to raise question first. * Amid disappointment and despair, I slowly started walking towards the exit gate. Though, my eye on Kirana Store Owner is still on. Fortunately, now could make an eye contact with him. We smiled at each other. It looks like they are now about to end the conversation. As expected, their gathering started to disperse. Everyone started walking towards the exit gate. The Nagar Sevak is in the lead, while others follow him. As Nagar Sevak gets closer, I realize he is going to pass me soon. This is my chance and cannot let it slip away. “How does it matter whether Nagar Sevak ignores me or handshakes me? I have already announced defeat to myself, anyway.” Surprisingly, at three or four feet away, Nagar Sevak asked me, “So you work for Emerson”. I was perplexed but said yes. He praised my company and engaged in conversation with me; it looks like he knows my company well. Other people around us are watching our conversation as if I am related to him. Finally, I asked him how he knew I was working for Emerson. He simply pointed his hand to my white shirt bearing company’s brand logo. [ Think and insert a creative sentence here.

Though ordering online crossed my mind, the absurd delivery charges stopped me. So, I did what a typical middle-class Indian husband would – hopped on my bike and headed to the nearby supermarket, just two kilometres away. Halfway across, staring at the traffic signal, I realised I had forgotten my helmet and raincoat. Classic me! As I stood there anxious about the impending rain, suddenly, my eye caught sight of a bicyclist passing close to my bike. He was visibly poor, his worn-out clothes clinging to his soaked body, yet he pedalled steadily through the traffic intersection on his old, battered cycle. Neither the rain nor the signal seemed to matter to him. The signal turned green, and I started moving just as a light sprinkle began to fall. A few meters ahead, I spotted the same cyclist again, still peddling relentlessly through the drizzle. But this time, I was ahead of him. However, as I continued, the light sprinkle suddenly turned into a torrential downpour, making it impossible to see the road ahead. Thankfully, I spotted a roadside tree and quickly pulled over to take shelter. As I stood there, drenched and silently regretting my decision not to opt for the online delivery option, my eyes caught sight of the cyclist again. Completely unfazed by the rain, he was cycling relentlessly. As I watched him, he crossed me once more. Then, it struck me – this was the same guy who had overtaken me twice, first at the signal, and here he was again. It spurred a weird sense of rivalry inside me, but before I could even digest it, a red car zoomed past, splashing a wave of muddy water all over me. Drenched and furious, my attention shifted instantly. How dare the driver? I thought, determined to catch up and give the driver a piece of my mind. But how can I chase a speeding car when I am myself stuck and helpless? I soon realized it was my hollow reaction. A few minutes later, as the rain began to ease, I wanted to let go of what had happened and restarted my bike, ready to move on. After a few meters ahead, I encountered a massive traffic jam, with vehicles crawling at a snail’s pace. There wasn’t much I could do about it. Then, out of the blue, I thought of the red car. It must be stuck in the traffic too. I realized that on my bike, I might have a chance to catch up to it. With renewed determination, I began searching for the red car in the traffic jam. After a while, I spotted it—on the far-right side of the road, while I was stuck on the left. Driving in this chaos would not be easy, but I wasn’t about to back down. I skillfully zigzagged through the mess, inch by inch. Yet every time I got closer, the traffic would crawl forward, and the red car slipped just out of reach. Frustration mounted, but I kept pushing, refusing to give up. Finally, as we approached the front of the line, the traffic light ahead suddenly turned red. My hope rekindled—this was my chance. I edged closer to the red car, ready to knock on the window and give the driver a piece of my mind. However, as I looked inside, I was taken aback to see a sexagenarian man in the driver’s seat. Perplexed, our eyes met, and he gave a gentle smile while gesturing toward my head, pointing out my missing helmet. I was taken aback to see a sexagenarian man in the driver’s seat. Perplexed, our eyes met, and he gave a gentle smile while gesturing toward my head, pointing out my missing helmet. Embarrassed, I exchanged a reluctant smile and quickly turned away. It was a double whammy—rather than teaching him a lesson, I learned one. It served as a reality check for me! This revelation hit me like a splash of cold water. My frustration gradually melted, and clarity began to dawn on me. Meanwhile, the rain intensified again, pushing me to find a way out quickly. Luckily, the left-turn signal for my lane turned green, giving me the perfect chance. I quickly made the turn, then took a right onto the adjoining road, where the green light was about to turn on. As I was about to pass through the signal, there he was once again—the cyclist! The same cyclist behind me was now approaching the signal. The relentless rain, the slick road, and the traffic signal—none of these could dampen his unwavering spirit. Watching him navigate each obstacle with determination, I felt a profound sense of humility. His silent courage challenged everything I believed about strength, success, and survival. In that profound moment, I understood a deeper truth about life. I realized that this unspoken race was one I had created, and the only way to truly honor his unbreakable spirit was to step aside. So, I slowed down my bike, letting him pass and overtake me—allowing him to win this unspoken race he never even knew he was part of. Thank you and enjoy your reading!

I felt a sense of superiority until I found myself in the same predicament, this month. Finally, I realised that even writing about the struggle of not getting ideas is worth writing. The writer may perceive their script as brilliant, but the reader may not share the same sentiment, and vice versa. Throughout history, we have seen countless failures and remarkable successes emerge from ordinary beginnings. Finally, I realised that even writing about the struggle of not getting ideas is worth writing. The writer may perceive their script as brilliant, but the reader may not share the same sentiment, and vice versa. Inspiration and ideas come from any source and anywhere. You cannot confine them to a particular place or isolate yourself in solitude to think. However, it is crucial to remain open and constantly attentive to your surroundings. If you are not actively looking for it, you’re bound to miss the spark. As the first half of 2023 passes and the second half beginning from July with the promise of heavy rainfall, let us seek blessings of mother earth to bestow upon us abundant resources and secure our food for the coming year. Furthermore, knowing that Lord Vishnu will be in slumber (Yoga Nidra) for the next four months, let us turn our focus for us to engage in spiritual and meditation practices. It is time for introspection and self-reflection as per Hindu Mythology. So, I wholeheartedly embrace this momentary lull with the hope that the muse will strike again when the time is right. Ideas will flow, creativity will spark, and the journey of creation will continue so long as we keep our senses alert and our hearts receptive. Thank you.",https://anecdotebox.com/the-muse/,388

Our mothers are divine in human form and their love teaches us our first lesson in grace. This year, I finally learned that lesson, not through words, but when life gently disrupted my well-laid plans. Every summer, my wife, daughters, and I travel to my hometown to reconnect with our family. My mother, now in her late eighties, lives in our childhood home along with my brother’s family. The plan was simple: a quiet week to unwind, catch up, and enjoy meaningful time together. But soon after we arrived, as if the universe were testing me, life threw a quiet twist. I realised something I had completely overlooked—Mother’s Day was the day after our departure. In my 50 years, I had never spent that day with my mother. As a child, I did not even know such a day existed. A heaviness occupied in my heart. This was the perfect chance to celebrate Mother’s Day with my mother, and now it seems like it is slipping away. I wanted to stay. I truly did. But when I saw the skyrocketing rescheduling air fares day after Mother’s Day, a flood of justifications rushed in: too expensive, not planned, not necessary. I could not help but wonder at our strange financial logic. We often say family, relationships , love is priceless—until a price tag shows up. Then suddenly, it’s not about feelings anymore. It is about fares. Choices. Calculations. We often easily spend on unplanned online shopping, fancy dinners, the latest gadgets, premium cars, and EMI-backed vacations. We do not think twice for our children’s stuff, and in moments of crisis or emergency, we empty our wallets without a second thought. Yet, when it comes to our aging parents—the people who gave everything to us , we become accountants. We ran the numbers. We convince ourselves: Maybe next time. That bitter truth stayed with me. I knew what the right choice was. But in the end, practicality prevailed. Logic won. And love quietly stepped aside. Eventually, I dropped the flight reschedule decision. As planned, we got into the cab for the airport—a three-hour ride to another city. Hearts heavy with goodbye, I smiled, but inside, the weight of missed moment felt like a shadow. However, halfway to the airport, my phone buzzed with breaking news: Pakistan conducts an airstrike across the border. Tensions rise. Airspace under review. What had been simmering after India’s missile strike on terrorist camps had now escalated dramatically. Flight cancellations began rolling in. By the time we reached the airport, an airline staff member confirmed it: “ Your flight’s canceled. No incoming aircraft. Airspace is frozen for now. ” For a moment, I stood frozen, too. The flight, I couldn’t justify changing; life had canceled it for me. Decided for me. I turned to my wife. There was nothing to discuss. “ We’re going back, ” I said. Not out of convenience—but out of grace. As we drove back, I was humbled by a quiet realisation: sometimes, when logic suppresses love, life steps in. When logic suppresses love, life steps in. The next morning, I was there for Mother’s Day. Not by plan. Not by obligation. But by grace. For the very first time in my life, I celebrated it not only with my mother but also with my wife’s mother. The irony? The money I had hesitated to spend on rescheduling ended up being spent anyway to rebook our flights. Looking back, if I had made that decision earlier, I would’ve saved money. But none of that mattered anymore. What mattered was the moment. The memory. The miracle of finally celebrating Mother’s Day with the woman who brought me into this world. It felt like fate made sure this special day happened just when it was supposed to, even though fifty years had passed. Thank you . Sometimes, what feels like a setback is actually a setup for something spectacular. Wishing you and your mom a wonderful Mother’s Day!

I usually spend about an hour reading the Sunday newspaper starting with the headlines, scanning through the major news stories of the week. Then I move on to the entertainment section, flipping through the latest Bollywood gossip and celebrity photos. However, things did not go as planned when the delivery boy arrived with the wrong newspaper. I called the news vendor to inquire about the mix-up, but he seemed unsure. Nevertheless, I was determined to get the same newspaper from another vendor. As I knew of a few vendors in the area, I set out on foot, determined to find a copy of the paper. After a few unsuccessful attempts, upon checking with a vendor, I found that today’s newspaper was expensive, so vendors only bought enough for their regular customers. Meanwhile, my phone buzzed, and a notification alert from my fitness app, “You passed your move ring after two months of irregularity. Be regular and keep walking!” I was about to give up and head back home; I saw that our nearby air-conditioned supermarket was open. At first, I hesitate, knowing that I do not need anything from the store except one hair colour sachet. But thought to go to the store to take a brief break in the air conditioning. As soon as entered inside, I felt a sense of relief and comfort. Since I only needed to purchase a sachet, I could not stay inside for long, so I decided to take a quick walk around the store. However, I realized that even if I did take a walk, it would only last a minute, so decided to spend some time in each section to browse. As I approached the Hair Care section to buy a colour sachet, noticed that one premium brand organic hair colour kit is available at a 50% discount, even though it was very expensive, ten times higher than the Sachet price, I wanted to treat myself and made the purchase. While going for the next section, I stumbled upon new food items that intrigued me. I picked up a packet of new millet (Shree Anna) noodles and some Korean-style Maggie. When saw a fresh orange cake with pistachios in the bakery section, which I had never seen before and found quite appealing. I grabbed a couple of packets to try. Next to the bakery section was international cuisine, picked up a tin of kidney bins (dark red) and one small container of Chunky Salsa. In the Veg and fruit frozen section, I found pre-packaged healthy salads – impressed with the labelling – Garden fresh salad (hydroponically grown in a controlled environment) ingredients- a crunchy blend of lettuce, kale, baby spinach, cherry tomato, sprouts, and exotic herbs with oregano. I decided that would be my morning break first, so bought one packet. Finally, while making my way home, realised that I had gone to buy a newspaper for Rs 10 but ended up with an array of products worth Rs 1100. While going for the next section, noticed a basil seed drink, and hurriedly bought one bottle. While standing at the payment counter, I spotted a new brand of malt-based ginger and peach beer in a beautiful stubby bottle, (Catchy labelling – Though non-alcohol it works), with a tempting buy-one-get-one-free offer. I could not resist and grabbed the offer. Finally, while making my way home, realised that I had gone to buy a newspaper for Rs 10 but ended up with an array of products worth Rs 1100. Feeling upset about my shopping frenzy, realised that my reckless buying behaviour deserved fitting punishment. I made up my mind to impose three-month ban on myself from online shopping but soon realised that Mega online Diwali festive sale event is due after one week, so thought it would be prudent to defer the ban decision. As I was entering my home and about to close the door, the elder daughter of our neighbour knocked. When I opened the door, she informed me that the newspaper boy had mistakenly delivered my paper to their house and wanted to know if their paper had been delivered to our house. She thanked me and left with their paper. Quite often, our psychological biases and decision-making processes override rational economic choices. We need to be Wallet-conscious.

I remember my old days of travelling by non-AC bus and then upgraded myself to AC bus when BEST introduced Volvo AC buses, first time in Mumbai. In the first week of Jan 2023, my car was due for service. My preference is always a service center near to my office, so Powai service center is convenient for me. I can drop off the car for service after arriving at the office and pick it up while leaving the office. No hassles! And we all know that time is essence of everything we do. As usual, I delivered my car to the Service Centre after reaching the office but couldn’t pick it up on the same day due to a power outage at the service center. The service advisor asked me to come the next day, but that day was work from home day for me, so did not work. After back-and-forth conversations, I was able to convince him for one day after. Though he reluctantly agreed but requested me to rate their service 10-10 on the company’s after-service call. His hidden request reminded me, nothing is free, everything is quid pro quo. Saw outside, Bus is crossing Airoli Bridge. Enjoyed the beauty of enormous sized transparent glass windows. Even though, I was not in my best of mood to come to the office but picking up car was my priority, thus coming to the office is must. Our office bus passes by my house everyday morning like a school bus for children but I am accustomed to arriving late at the office bus stop, so it does not suit me. The next available option for me is either Ola or Uber cab service. I typically haggle between Ola and the Uber fare rate before taking a decision. In our last negotiation article, we talked about how we negotiate 24/7. Haggling is a lower form of negotiation. Many of us have assumed that bargaining or haggling is our fundamental right, especially against street vendors and hawkers. However, that right somehow vanishes when we shop from Branded Store. Even though I spent 15 to 20 minutes between switching both the APPs to get a better deal, but no luck. All of a sudden, my old days of commuting to the office by public transport hit my mind and intrigued me; so, started to feel better and wanted to get rid of this Ola and uber conundrum. Remember, remembering your old days will make you feel happy, no matter how painful and struggling it has been. I decided to pursue my rekindled interest of going to the office by bus and hurried to same nearby old bus stop. But after arriving at the bus stop, realized that I could not remember the bus No and did not know if that bus was still following that route. Though slightly confused, but no loss of confidence and, eagerly waiting for the bus to come. 10 to 15 minutes have passed but no sign of any bus for the Powai Route. Although, in every minute, other route buses are passing, and passengers are taking and getting down; I am just a mute spectator. Passerby Autorickshaws are constantly checking with me if I go to nearby locations. Interesting Facts Karl Benz invented the first motorized bus in 1895. In 1906, France started bus line. The first motor bus route in India started on July 15, 1926, and ran between Afghan Church and Crawford Market, Mumbai. Fare twenty-five paisa Again, saw outside, crossing Powai bridge. Now days, carrying cash in pocket is no longer my habit. Always use UPI and other wallet services for sundry expenses. A decade ago, nobody would have imagined that we all can move around freely and comfortably without money in the pocket. Today’s possibility is yesterday’s impossibility. Not being sure whether the Bus conductor will accept wallet payment, wanted to have petty cash, and thankfully found an ATM behind the bus stop. As waiting time prolongs, impatience sets in. I am negotiating between waiting and impatience. Impatient is saying that I should have gone by Ola or Uber while waiting does not give me any answer, except hope. Patience gives necessary resolve to face the blips in the journey of life that are bound to happen: faith gives the realization that this shall too pass [The Speaking Tree] In the very next moment, my eyes saw a red color AC bus displaying no 125 is approaching the bus stop. Instantly, my subconscious mind recognized it as the same old bus. I was thrilled and felt ecstatic about my accomplishment. But when asked the conductor ticket for Powai stop, pleasantly surprised to hear the fare he asked. I wondered how come the price of public transport will be almost 50% cheaper over 12 years. I assumed the conductor made a mistake and tried to take the unfair advantage of keeping quiet. But after a while, my consciousness broke and compelled me to recheck the fare with the conductor. I used to pay Rs 80 or 90 for the same ride 12 years ago, but now it is Rs 50. Bus conductor told me one year before BEST cut bus fares by 50%. A big sigh of relief to my consciousness. My stop arrived. In a world strapped for time, it is hard for us to find time to write our own memorable moments and beautiful experiences. We know we all gaze at our phones and computers for hours nonstop. I could have easily taken a couple of selfies sitting in the bus or standing at the bus stop and uploaded to my Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn posts. That may have generated few likes and wonderful comments. But believe me, if you capture your wonderful experiences and rare moments and try to put them into writing, it will work a miracle for you. I do not know how others will get vicarious pleasure reading your story, but you will certainly be delightful, joyfull, and enlightened.",https://anecdotebox.com/bus-no-125/,1021

I checked my phone, which was still asleep with the screen off, but I didn’t want to disturb it. I was determined not to make any noise or turn on any lights that might wake anyone. The only light I had to manage was a low-power dim lamp. Although it was a challenge, I had no choice but to prepare myself without waking anyone up. I carefully moved to the bathroom, being mindful of every action I took. I went to the kitchen to make my usual tea, but to avoid any noise from opening the fridge or clanking utensils, I opted for just hot water with dip tea powder. It was an unfamiliar test, but silence demanded compromise. After finishing my tea, I headed to the bathroom to shave, taking extra care to avoid making any noise with the razor or tapping it against the sink. Once I finished shaving, I took a quick shower, again being mindful of the noise level. I made sure to close the bathroom door slowly to keep the sound under control. After drying off, I carefully opened my wardrobe and selected the clothes I wanted to wear for my early morning travel. I learned that precision and silence do not come with speed. precision and silence do not come with speed. While everyone in the house was asleep and I was almost ready, I remembered that I needed to use my regular body deodorant spray and talcum powder. However, realising that the fragrance might wake others up, I decided to avoid using them. I’m all set. I’ll take my laptop bag, softly whisper to my wife about my departure, and press the small push-button lock before stepping out, ensuring the door locks from the inside. This is the last phase of my silent operation. Until now, I have successfully employed my stealthy skills. As soon as I lifted the laptop bag, I didn’t realise it was unzipped, and my laptop fell out, crashing to the floor with a loud noise that woke both my mother and my wife. My wife asked what had happened, and I replied, “Nothing.” She then asked why I hadn’t turned on the light, and I remained silent. My cab had arrived, and I always preferred to sit in the front seat. This way, I can easily talk to the driver, make use of my travel time, and avoid becoming too irritated if we get stuck in traffic. As usual, I took the front seat and opened the map app to check the route, but I quickly turned it off to conserve my phone’s battery. Nowadays, it’s not just about saving money while traveling; it’s also saving battery life on our mobile devices. On our way, we had to pass through a toll gate. As my cab entered the toll lane, I suddenly noticed a poultry van in front of us, filled with crates of live chickens. It was painful for me to see the birds in such conditions, and I hoped the van would cross the toll booth first so that I could escape the sight. Once the van passed through the toll gate, I asked the driver to overtake it, and he agreed. I felt a bit relieved after that. As we continued our journey, we reached a traffic signal about ten minutes later. Just as we approached, the light turned red. When I glanced out of my window—and there it was again, the same poultry van, slowly coming to a stop right beside my car. It all happened so quickly that I made eye contact with few birds inside the van. I realised they were staring at me, and I wondered if they were trying to convey something to me. Though I wanted to turn away my face, I couldn’t. The traffic signal was yet to turn green, and I couldn’t help but feel a deep sadness in my heart. I wondered if they knew what was about to happen to them. The longer I looked into their eyes, the stronger I felt a connection with them. Their silent pleadings and obvious helplessness conveyed a profound sense of life’s fragility. But I knew there was nothing I could do. The traffic light turned green. While I had to take a right turn, I noticed that the van continued straight. As the van disappeared, a sense of helplessness washed over me, knowing that I was powerless to change it. The memory of those birds and the emotions they had stirred inside me would remain imprinted in my mind forever.

Little did I know my chilling adventure would turn into a heated ordeal. As I started my bike and prepared to ride just two kilometers to the mall, I met congestion at the traffic signal, which was caused by non-functioning lights due to the power outage. To my dismay, the congestion worsened as each vehicle tried to move ahead, creating an even bigger jam. Finding myself trapped in maddening congestion with cars honking and tempers flaring, I felt like I was slowly roasting under the mid-noon sun. Clutching my bike tightly, struggling to move an inch, I felt the searing heat of the direct sun piercing through me. With the humidity exacerbating the situation, it seemed as if the heat and humidity were sent by The Nature to teach us about the consequences of climate change. The relentless afternoon sun beat down mercilessly, wrapping me in what felt like a frying pan. With each passing minute, I felt like I was melting away, desperately seeking an escape from this chaos. Seeing others sitting in their cars with the air conditioning on only added fuel to the fire, intensifying my agony. It’s true what they say: envy only amplifies the pain. Amidst the chaos, I realized it was better to move under the tree shadows to get some relief, but the trees were in the middle of the road divider. I was on the other lane and needed to cross horizontally to reach that lane. As I tried to maneuver my bike to that side, I struggled to find small gaps to pass through, making it a laborious task. When I finally found a narrow gap between two cars and tried to take my bike towards the tree shade, one car driver rolled down his window and cautioned me not to pass, worried that his brand-new car might get scratched. My body was getting scorched by the heatwave, yet it seemed the car held more value than a human being. Feeling helpless and unable to bear the heat, I noticed a bank ATM on my side of the road and thought it would be better to go inside for some time, parking my bike behind a stationary auto. But to my utter dismay, there was a display board showing “Out of Service.” Not all solutions lie in looking forward; often, they can be found by looking backward. That’s why we say it is important to assess the situation with a 360-degree view. By this time, sweat had drenched me completely, making me feel dehydrated. Helplessly looking here and there, praying for the arrival of a traffic inspector to manage the signal, I couldn’t help but wonder how highly educated individuals like us manage to lose sight of basic civic sense. As the traffic situation went from bad to worse, with everyone trying to outsmart each other and ending up in a jam, it felt like a comedy of errors orchestrated by the summer heat. While enduring this nightmare, I suddenly heard an ambulance siren approaching on our side of the road. I thought, “Now things will move…” and felt a bit of relief, expecting people to clear the way. But to my dismay, the driver of the ambulance backed up to avoid the jam, turned back, and took an alternative route. All my hopes vanished in an instant. I regretted my decision to go to the mall for air conditioning, only to end up in this ordeal. There was no sign of any police inspector, and car honking was constantly blaring as if honking the cars would help solve the problem. But then, the ambulance driver’s wit and quick decision to turn back inspired me to follow his path. I thought, “Why not do the same and escape this mess?” Without a moment’s delay, I asked a few fellow bikers behind me to relay the message to others to turn back as well. Everyone liked the idea and began to act on it. Slowly, we saw the results as vehicles started to turn back. Just as my turn came, I heard a traffic inspector’s whistle. Thank you.

Unexpected savings or income instantly brings us joy and excitement, no matter how much the amount. However, when unforeseen expenses or outgoings catch us off guard, we suddenly feel utterly clueless. It’s around 1 PM on a sunny Sunday. I find myself lonely and stuck until evening when my wife and children return from the wedding. Though an orphan feeling is slowly creeping up on me, my quirky mind is buzzing with ideas on how to treat myself like I am in my 20s for the day. Without a solid plan in mind, I headed to the nearby South Indian restaurant for a quick lunch – less about hunger and more about passing time. Upon arriving, I encountered the usual Sunday crowd. Luckily, I spotted a friend from my 30s sitting in a corner. As I approached him, we were equally thrilled to see each other – a reminiscent feeling of old 70s Hindi movies where brothers, separated in childhood, find assured union when they become adults. Indeed, we had a wonderful lunch, delightful and truly enjoyed, releasing floods of good old memories. when I offered to pay for the meal, my friend strongly resisted and insisted on treating me. Unexpected savings on my meal made me realise that happiness can be found in even the smallest things in life. Now It’s 2:30 PM. Feeling unsure of what to do, I began driving home until another plan struck my mind. However, a Hindi movie featuring a Bollywood Superstar was playing in a nearby cinema hall, which caught my attention. Intrigued, I checked the showtime on my mobile app and found it was starting at 3 p.m. Swiftly, I opened my mobile app to book the ticket online. However, when the convenience fees appeared alongside the ticket price, I hesitated. To save 15% on fees, I decided to buy the ticket directly from the cinema hall counter. I truly enjoyed the movie, and even realised it was a better choice than attending the wedding. While I wonder how quickly my focus has shifted from a 20s spending mindset to a 50s saving mindset. When I asked for a ticket at the counter, the attendant showed me the computer screen having two seats available in the middle of the row, but I preferred side seats. While glancing through the computer screen my eye fell on the next row having a side seat. But when I checked with the counter boy, he told me the next row starts with the economy class and confirmed that side seats are available. But the word ‘economy class made me hesitate for a moment. However, I suddenly connected it with my travels in economy class on flights, so how does it matter? I chose that option to save an extra 20%. And then, Just as I was about to proceed, unexpectedly a young boy hurriedly approached me and asked if I would take his insignia class ticket at half of the price as he had to rush due to some unforeseen personal emergency. Saving encourages more saving. First forward to end of movie. I truly enjoyed the movie, and even realised it was a better choice than attending the wedding. While stepping out of the cinema hall, I recollected all my savings and suddenly realised that I had missed one more savings. It was about saving on parking charges by leaving my bike in the unsecured area of the mall, instead of Cinema Hall paid parking. No matter how much I tried to prove my innocence with my corporate polished convince and negotiation skills, she remained stubborn Thrilled by the unexpected savings, I kick-started my bike, and without a second thought, decided to take a shortcut to home, driving a few meters on the wrong side of the road. But to my utter dismay, as soon as I found myself on the wrong side, a traffic inspector miraculously appeared out of nowhere, pointing a phone camera at me. Caught off guard, unsure of what to do. She asked me “driver’s license please” and questioned me about my missing helmet. No matter how much I tried to prove my innocence with my corporate polished convince and negotiation skills, she remained stubborn. Frustrated with the non-working of any of my skills in the greatest hour of need, I desperately looked for a cup of tea from a roadside tea cart. As I savoured the tea, a message notification alert flashed on my mobile. Mumbai traffic police – E-challans for two traffic violations. please make the online payment through the given link within 15 days to avoid court proceedings. To my utter disbelief, the fine amount was ten times the day’s savings. Sometimes, it takes just one impulsive choice to nullify all the responsible actions and decisions we’ve made. The art of living with dignity lies in our ability to manage both our spending and saving habits wisely. Thank you.",https://anecdotebox.com/thank-you-sunday/,826

Do you hold the misconception that females should manage office reception jobs? Do you believe that boy children should only play with toy trucks and girls with dolls? These are just a few examples of gender stereotypes. There are many others, and they can have a significant impact on people’s lives. In simple words, gender stereotypes are beliefs and expectations about the characteristics and roles associated with men and women .They involve appearance, personality, behaviour, and roles. These stereotypes are so deeply rooted in society that it defines what means to be a man and women. In more precisely , gender stereotypes are preconceived ideas about how people of different genders should behave and act. Unfortunately, they can restrict opportunities, self-expression and, create biases. Recognising the importance of addressing this issue, the Supreme Court of India has recently published a 30-page handbook called ‘Combating gender stereotypes. This handbook includes a glossary of gender-biased terms and offers alternative words and phrases that can be used in court proceedings and court orders as gender-neutral words or languages. Few examples from the Supreme Court’s Handbook. The word “Affair” was replaced with “relationship outside of marriage”. “Provocative clothing” was replaced with “clothing. “Transsexual” was replaced with “transgender. “Whore” was replaced with “woman.” “Provider” or “breadwinner” replaced with “employed” or “earning.” In a 2021 judgment, the Supreme Court used the term ‘homemaker’ instead of ‘housewife.’ This decision helped reshape how we view the word ‘housewife.’ In last month’s story, ‘The Potluck,’ you may have noticed that the word ‘homemaker’ was used for one of the characters. Below are few examples to demonstrate how words/ language can be adjusted to be more inclusive and gender-neutral in various contexts. Instead of”manpower,” use “workforce.” Instead of “fireman,” use “firefighter.” Instead of “policeman,” use “police officer.” Instead of “salesman,” use “salesperson.” Instead of “businessman,” use “entrepreneur. Instead of “chairman,” use “chair” or “chairperson.” Instead of “mankind,” use “humanity” or “humankind.” Instead of “guys” when you address a group of people use “team or folks” Gender-neutral language is crucial for fostering Diversity, equity and inclusion. It is important to encourage and practice use of inclusive language in all our communications, policies, procedures, and daily interactions. This will help to eliminate the use of outdated words or phrases that are not gender-neutral. I would encourage you to read the Handbook Published by the Supreme Court of India.

I am excited about this opportunity. All my competitors, except for one, are at a similar level of skill set since we all learned this skill during lockdown (thanks to COVID-19). But one of my colleagues is very strong in culinary experience and claims he was selected for a Master Chef (TV show) audition but couldn’t participate due to a burning finger injury while practicing. Anyway, given the current high demand for multi-skilled jobs in the job market, I have already included my cooking skills in my resume. After browsing many social media videos, shortlisted two dishes to experiment and accordingly finalise one for the event.1) Jasmine rice with Thai curry, and 2) Garlic Boursin finger sandwiches. I bought all the ingredients from our nearby supermarket while returning from the office to home. Our kitchen is free after 8 pm, and my wife has only one non-negotiable condition: the kitchen should be neat and clean after my experiment. Day One Experiment Recipe – Jasmine rice with Thai curry. I opened the video to follow the steps while preparing. Ingredients: 1 cup jasmine rice, 1 can coconut milk,1 tbsp Thai red curry paste, 1 tbsp soya sauce,1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 red bell pepper, sliced, 1 onion, sliced, 1 carrot, sliced, 1 cup chopped broccoli Instructions: Rinse and drain the jasmine rice.2) In a pot, combine the rice with 1 1/2 cups water and boil it for 15-20 minutes or until rice is cooked. 4) In a separate pot, combine coconut milk, curry paste, soya sauce, and brown sugar and boil it for 1 minute and then add the sliced vegetables.6) Simmer for 5-7 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Serve curry on top of the cooked rice. The aroma of jasmine rice was so tempting that everyone in my family was impressed and wanted to try it. My youngest daughter, a nine-year-old, was the first to try it. However, after one spoonful, she started experiencing symptoms of vomiting. My wife was worried and immediately asked my daughter to wash her mouth. She warned me not to experiment with food on family members and advised to take the dishes to the office for colleagues to taste instead. I chose not to argue with her and instead reflected on where I went wrong. Upon rewatching the video, I found that I had poured one bottle of soy sauce instead of 1 tablespoon, as I was on a call with my boss while preparing the dish. Day Two Today I am extra careful and made myself clear that no distraction/ no phone call, razor focus on the recipe in hand. Watched each step-in video with absolute concentration. Experiment Recipe – Garlic Boursin finger sandwiches🥪 Ingredients: Slices of bread (white or wheat), 2) one package of Garlic Boursin cheese, 3) fillings and toppings (such as sliced cucumber, tomato, or lettuce) Instructions: Lay out slices of bread .2) Spread Garlic Boursin cheese on each slice of bread. 3) Add sliced cucumber, tomato, or lettuce.4) Place another slice of bread on top of each sandwich. 5) Cut each sandwich into 4 small, bite-sized pieces and serve it. However, falling short on ideas, I soon released that the leadership and people management skills or strategies that we learn in corporate life do not work in family settings. As I was making the sandwich, my wife told me that she would be visiting to the beauty parlour alone, again reminding that not to experiment the dish with my daughter who was attending her online class. When I checked whether she was going to her regular famous name ‘Skin Beauty Parlour’, she replied yes, but informed me that they have recently changed their name to ‘Green Beauty Parlour’.It seems like everyone is going green these days, one way or another. Even one of my close friends was checking with me regarding the legal procedure of name change as he wanted to change his name from Purna to Green Purna. As soon as she left, I couldn’t resist the opportunity and decided to convince my daughter for one bite. Immediately after her online class ended, I started trying to convince her. However, falling short on ideas, I soon released that the leadership and people management skills or strategies that we learn in corporate life do not work in family settings. After some persuasion, she agreed to taste, and we both agreed to keep it confidential. When I gave her a bite, and as I was on a phone call, she exclaimed loudly that it was super delicious and said “Dad, you will rock!” The beauty of cooking lies in the pleasure of sharing it with others. Thank You, and once again “Happy Women’s Day.” 🙏",https://anecdotebox.com/bring-to-the-table-win-win-survival-strategies-to-ensure-proactive-customer-service-2/,874

So, look beyond, and hear more in negotiation than talk. Living life is a constant process of making transactions, in every moment, we negotiate with our children, our workers, staff, customers, vendors and, so on. A significant amount of time passes. We need to invent new way of doing things. Efficient negotiation requires less speech and more listening. It is critically important to place greater emphasis on understanding the underlying needs, interests, motivations, and desire to reach an agreement. The concept of a soft and hard approach to negotiations is effective in conducting negotiations and, helps to avoid deadlock too. As you negotiate, separate people from the problem. Using a soft approach to people sitting on the table and a tough approach to the problem at hand is going to create magic. Be firm on the price you want for your products, but be sweet, respectful, polite to people seated in front. But the stalemate is inevitable when applied in reverse. Efficient negotiation requires less speech and more listening. It is critically important to place greater emphasis on understanding the underlying needs, interests, motivations, and desire to reach an agreement. Negotiation is a dynamic process where positions can change and evolve, so focus on interest, not on positions. If the likely outcomes are not very encouraging, pause. Go to the Balcony. The Balcony is a place of perspective, self-mastery and calm where you can open to yourselves. You may not progress well in the negotiation but keep your confidence intact. Losing confidence during a negotiation is a disaster. Identify the best alternatives and continue to work on it, which will act like a booster for your confidence. Think, if your confidence is on the rise, nothing is wasted. Negotiating means changing someone else’s mind. This is an exercise in influence. But how can you influence someone unless you master on managing your own thoughts and actions. So, Master on yourself first. Understand that mutually beneficial results do not necessarily require equal sharing. Look beyond that; both parties can have the best chance to get what they need by identifying each other’s needs. The key is to learn from the orange quarrel of Mira and Radha Do not mistake negotiation with bargaining. Ask yourself whether you are bargaining or negotiating? Negotiation is collaborative approach to find a mutually acceptable solution while Bargaining is a competitive approach to maximize individual gain. Quite often, we are bargaining thinking as if we are negotiating. In negotiation, we want to know why they want and in bargaining, what they want. We cannot discuss what they really want without knowing why they want it. Thus, what they want will follow why they want, no other way. Enjoy the reading. Keep listening.

Oxford defines the goblin mode as “a type of behavior which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations.” Use of your selfies generated by Artificial intelligence instead of your mobile phone camera can be an example of your goblin mode. The word “selfie” was selected in 2013 as “Word of the Year”. You can imagine how important the word is today that we all use daily. Watch from home instead of work from home may be an interesting example. Employees are no longer happy to come daily to the office for work. Are they in goblin mode? Words are important because they are the building blocks of any language and allow people to convey their thoughts, ideas, and feelings and essential to communicate. I have only watched one game of the FIFA World Cup 2022 and that is the final match between Argentina and France. Overwhelmed, satisfied, upset and an incredible experience, the pleasure of this game made me feel that I watched all the matches of the tournament. We are all excited, enthusiastic and feel better by reading stories, watching movies, watching games, though unrelated to us, is an example of vicarious pleasure. Do you know? “Workaholic” is the Word of the year in 1980 and “VAX”in 2021. Words are important because they are the building blocks of any language and allow people to convey their thoughts, ideas, and feelings and essential to communicate. In addition to their role in communication, the words we use can influence how we think and feel about the things we are talking about and, we use to inspire, or motivate others. Collin’s dictionary has also selected the Word of the year is “quiet quitting.” The practice of doing no more work than contractually obliged to do called “quiet quitting.” On similar lines Merriam-Webster goes with ‘gaslight’ as Word of the Year. The word originally defined as psychological manipulation of a person usually for an extended period that creates confusion, loss of confidence and self-esteem and increases the dependency on the perpetrator. In simple words, it can be an act or practice of grossly misleading someone over a period for personal gain. Fake news, biased, misleading narratives are today’s gaslight.

No matter how old you are, unless you have a childlike spirit in you, you’re surely missing out on the richness of life. After continuous rain for the last few days, this morning brought us its shining beauty: clear skies and golden sunshine. What made it even more special was that today was Gandhi Jayanti. In our neighbourhood, an NGO runs coaching classes providing free education to poor and underprivileged children in our vicinity. Though children are economically poor, one thing they have in abundance is dreams. And their dreams are so closely tied to my childhood memories that I enthusiastically participate in all their programs. Today, in celebration of Gandhiji’s birthday, the NGO has organized a ‘Swachh Abhiyan,’ a simple yet profound program to clean a one-kilometre stretch of our main street lane. Moreover, about 50 to 60 eager and enthusiastic children were ready to take part in this mission. The atmosphere was brimming with excitement, with the singing of national anthems and patriotic songs. As we stood ready, cheers erupted, welcoming the children.However, just they are about to start, an unexpected turn of events emerged as a potential threat, jeopardising the entire program. Suddenly, a kind-hearted passer-by hurriedly stopped his car and approached me, whispering into my ear. He informed me that child labour laws in India do not allow children under the age of 14 to engage in labour. This revelation took us by surprise because most of the children involved in the ‘Swachh Abhiyan’ were under the legal age threshold. A moment of realisation dawned on us. This crucial point had somehow slipped our meticulous minds.Although, it was an unforgivable mistake, fortunately, there was no breaking of the law. We need to think quickly to handle this challenging situation instead of dwelling on mistakes, as people nearby were watching us expectantly. With no other choice , we all adults grabbed brooms and dustpans and began the Swachh Abhiyan. Though our enthusiasm ran high, we lacked physical abilities, especially when it came to tasks like sweeping and cleaning, which we typically left to domestic housemaids. In the meantime, my hunger had intensified, as I had left home hurriedly without breakfast. As anticipated, after just a few meters of cleaning, fatigue set in. Despite our eagerness to finish quickly, the physical labour proved to be quite challenging, and we were all in desperate need of rest. However, this experience reinforced us the importance of physical skills in a world that often prioritises intellectual abilities. In the meantime, my hunger had intensified, as I had left home hurriedly without breakfast. Finally, albeit with great difficulty , we managed to finish the cleaning operation, Now, It is time for the snack distribution, and all the super excited children are lined up for samosas. The delicious aroma of samosas filled the air, tempting my taste buds. Though in order of priority, the children’s quota comes first, my hunger pushes me to ask for a samosa without waiting in line. While my tingling tongue betrays me, behaving like a child’s, my introverted shyness forcefully overpowers my confidence. While I was grappling with these invisible and unexpressed emotions, the gentleman serving the samosas got a phone call. As I was standing close to him, he requested me to distribute samosas to the children while he took the call. I knew this was a great chance to keep one for myself. However, when duty calls, sacrifices must be made. So, to resist my temptation, and console my hunger, a profound reasoning struck to my mind that serving food to others is a sacred act and a unique pleasure in today’s world, where being served is the norm. However, when I got hold of the samosa box, I soon realized that there might not be enough samosas for everyone. The teachers were up next after the children, and there were four of them. My hope dwindled. I distributed three samosas to the teachers. Just as I was about to give the last samosa to a teacher, she politely declined, mentioning her Jain dietary restrictions due to the presence of onion and garlic in the samosas. My hope sprang back to life as I realised that I could now enjoy the samosa. But fate, as often does, had other plans. Just as I was about to leave, a child approached me with his sister, explaining that his sister had just arrived and had not received a samosa. A faint smile appeared on my face. The true worth of our lives resides in the child within us. Remember, it is an integral part of who we are. Can’t we be childlike without being childish?

If you tend to overthink or overdo what you need to do, no matter how difficult or simple the task is, you will never get around to doing it. So do it. This year’s annual day at my daughter’s school I held a special place in my heart. Unlike past years, where last-minute office tours kept me away, this time everything else could wait. Fate almost intervened again, but I narrowly escaped as a high-profile meeting with the Global President concluded just a day before the event. Feeling fortunate, I was ready to soak up every moment. My daughter had been practising tirelessly for her celestial chores, and I couldn’t wait to see her shine. It was around 9 AM, and my wife and I were set, ready to head to the school. As we approached, the air buzzed with excitement, I dropped her off at the school gate. Just as I was parking the car a short distance away, my phone rang. It was my wife, her voice tinged with sudden panic. She informed me that the invitation was for one parent only—a detail she had completely overlooked. “I’m so sorry,” she added with her voice cracking. Though I respect her oops moment, unfortunately, even the sincerest apology won’t change the situation. Unsure how to handle this sudden turn of events, I felt a wave of emotion. This moment meant the world to me, and now it was slipping away. I had missed previous events, and this was my last chance before my daughter moved on to a higher grade where annual days wouldn’t include parents. The next opportunity might be when my grandchildren go to school—a distant dream. Taking a deep breath and embracing a calm nonchalance , I urged my wife to proceed as the designated parent while I figured out a solution. I sat in my car, gripping the steering wheel, trying to process the disgusting situation. Then, suddenly, an idea struck me— I quickly called my wife and asked her to WhatsApp me the photo of the invitation card. With the digital copy on mobile, I believed I could confidently approach the entrance and, if questioned about a physical copy, claim that I had left it at home. Though the idea seemed promising, fear of being refused at the entrance—and the potential blow to my reputation—held me back. I could not summon the courage to implement the plan. Locked in battle of thoughts, I abandoned the plan and decided on a safer approach: look for some known teachers to request entry. Fifteen minutes passed with no sign of anyone familiar face — like often we do not get what we search for. As I stood near the school pondering my options, I saw my phone ringing. It was my wife. She let me know that my daughter’s friend wouldn’t be able to attend because of a family emergency. She had already spoken to them, and they were ready to share their invitation card and asked if I could visit their home to pick it up. It seemed like a brilliant idea—their house was only a kilometre away. I hurried back to my car, which was parked a few meters from the school gate. But to my dismay, someone had parked their car in a way that blocked mine. Frustrated and helpless, I felt nearly defeated. Just as I was about to call my wife to tell her I wouldn’t make it, another idea sparked—why not use technology differently? I could video call her and watch the event virtually. Though it was a good option to salvage the situation, something didn’t feel right and I started hesitating. I knew the experience would be different if I were there in person. Once more, I found myself stuck, hesitating between options, unsure which was right. Ten minutes later, I found myself wandering near the school gate, directionless, my mind swirling with possibilities, but they all led back to one fear: what if I was denied entry? What would people think of me? How would my reputation suffer? As I stood there wrestling with these thoughts, I noticed a small child, three or four year old, confidently walking ahead, not even holding his mother’s hand. His fearless stride struck me. Watching him, I realized my struggle wasn’t due to a lack of ability, knowledge, or desire. It was simply fear—fear of rejection, fear of what others might think. This simple insight made me question everything. If I was the hero of my own story, why should I let others’ opinions control me? I didn’t need to wait for someone else to fix the situation; I just needed to take charge. With that realization, I gathered the courage to move forward boldly. I walked up to the gate, fully confident and ready to explain my situation. But before I could say a word, the teacher at the entrance hurriedly said, “Sir, you’re already late; please enter quickly,” without even looking at me. A wave of relief washed over me as I stepped inside. Thank you. Many times, it is not our lack of skill or abilities, but simply the fear of failure or rejection that holds us back from taking life-changing actions. What truly matters is having the courage to move forward despite that fear. Happy reading.",https://anecdotebox.com/just-do-it/,893

Once you’re in, you have to exit, there’s no other option. What truly matters is the actions you take and the impact you make while you are inside. Remember, the sacrifices you make and the penance you undertake will define your legacy. Little did I know that picking up my daughter from her competitive exam venue would present an unexpected challenge. The huge crowd of parents near the exit gate —like a Kumbha Mela fair—made me realise that the next half-hour would test my patience and endurance, much like a student in an exam hall. Thirty minutes to go. The Exit gate crowd atmosphere creates a feeling of uneasiness and discomfort, making the act of waiting difficult. Moreover, the throng of parents at the exit shows no sign of subsiding. As I stand there, memories of my exam days remind me of how my friends and I used to pedal our bicycles to the exam Centre, often two sharing one cycle. Nowadays, it seems like a full family event to drop off and pick up a child, leading to inevitable crowds. In my time, smearing sandalwood paste on the forehead was believed to bring success in exams, no matter how well-prepared one was. However, as time passes, traditional beliefs, rituals and practices are often dismissed as superstitious. The fact is, economic prosperity can change people’s perception of faith. As material well-being improves, faith may be seen as superstition by the rich, but for the poor, it may be still an expression of their beliefs or faith. The exit gate is fully engulfed by standing parents, resulting in restricted movement. The discarded plastic bottles are littered all over the ground like orphans. All parents were anxious, and eagerly awaiting how soon the exit gate would open. However, time flows differently. For the student in the examination hall, time flows fast, but for parents waiting outside, time flows slowly. I notice that few parents lift their phones, cameras in hand using the zoom feature to spot their children when they will pass through the gate. Although the security staff warns blaring their portable speakers to avoid a stampede, unfortunately, their words fall on deaf ears. It seems listening is a rare commodity in the crowd. The exit gate was a sight to behold. Last 15 minutes to go. Amidst my challenges, I noticed an exhausted young boy approaching me carrying a worn-out bag on the back. It seems he wants to talk to me, but not getting confident. He hesitantly came closer and asked, “Uncle, how can I reach this place?” I was perplexed and replied, “But you’re already here.” Why are you asking? He explained that he had come for a site pre- inspection of the venue for his upcoming competitive exam next week. He also recounted the difficulty he faced during his strenuous five-hour travel time to cover a mere 40 kilometres from his home to the venue. Feeling a deep sense of disappointment and helplessness, I could not find any other means to help him but silently whisper my heartfelt wish, “May God bless you.” I felt a deep sense of compassion for him and was determined to help him by providing a well-thought- out route plan. But the crowd was now becoming increasingly uncontrollable, and my strong toes were the only thing keeping me standing. Any moment, the final exam bell will ring, and students’ fate will be sealed. Though I am trying various alternative route plans for him but struggling to find a suitable one. I realized optimizing time to destination in the absence of price is too difficult. In the meantime, the crowded chaos had swiftly separated me from the boy, leaving us three to four feet apart and the distance between us kept widening. Suddenly, a brilliant and innovative route plan came to my mind, but how could I pass it on to him in this nosy crowd? I struggled to get closer to him, but the chaotic crowd made it extremely difficult to walk even a few feet towards him. Although he looks at me and I look at him, it is impossible to communicate. As the crowd became more intense, I feared that my chance of helping him would vanish at any moment. Even though my watchful eye remained fixed on him, he disappeared from my sight into the bustling crowd. Feeling a deep sense of disappointment and helplessness, I could not find any other means to help him but silently whisper my heartfelt wish, “May God bless you.” The timing of people entering or exiting our lives is something beyond our control. What matters most is the impact we have on one another during the time we share. Thank you for being a part of my journey.",https://anecdotebox.com/exit-gate/,801

Respect and influence are both essential for effective leadership, and they work together as co-partners to help a leader achieve success. However, if just a phone call takes away the leader’s opportunity, both the partners may suddenly cease to exist. This interesting insight bestowed upon me while I was writing my speech for a sustainability conference, sitting in a naturally air-conditioned setting. Well, I am not a polished public speaker, but this opportunity came to me through one of my political contacts. So, I am putting my best effort into composing my speech and rehearsing it thoroughly. Sustainability is an idea or a concept that aims to establish a harmonious balance between society and nature. One World, One Family. This concept or idea enables us to coexist with other species and the environment without causing harm. Interestingly, these concepts, ideas and values are not new; they have been present in literature, religious texts, and history for centuries. The current global climate crisis has brought these ideas to the forefront like never before. That said, in a world where economic growth is top priority over all else, how to find a harmonious balance that benefits society as a whole? GDP (Gross Domestic product) is the key economic indicator to measure the economic growth. However, this indicator does not provide complete picture of well-being of Society. To measure social and environmental growth, we need an alternative indicator to GDP (Goss domestic Prosperity). But implementing such a metric is easier to preach than to practice. To understand and explain this topic more deeply, it is important to take real life instances that we encounter. A few years back, a doctor suggested knee replacement surgery for my mother, as her knee had deteriorated due to aging and normal wear and tear. However, my mother refused for replacement and chose to continue with the medicine only, fully knowing that relief of her pain would not be possible without a replacement. This begs the question, why we hesitate or unwilling to change our body parts, even when advance medical science offers diverse options. Why do we choose to endure discomfort and inconvenience instead of the replacement option? Do you see any logic or reason to continue with the same damaged parts, with inconvenience and discomfort? For most of us, changing a body part is a last resort. The body stands for our own existence, unique identity, a feeling of self, irrespective of healthy or not. There is a potent emotion attached to it. Losing a body part means a fear of losing a sense of self. As a result, we cannot easily substitute any of our body parts. It does not matter how damaged they are, so long as it sustains. It is important to understand here that our own consumption habits and behaviours are the cornerstones of all the sustainability livings that we are talking about today. Though the most straightforward approach for sustainable living is to make our lifestyle choices based on our needs. However, if we apply the same principles to the things we use in our daily lives, it reveals a stark contrast. We change our cars, clothes, mobiles, devices, and countless items of everyday use much faster than their life expectancy. The mobile phone battery life is 2-3years, while we change mobile phones every two years or even less. We change our clothes or buy even more, though we do not come to the office daily. Now days, our spending or buying decision is based on discounts, easy EMI, cash back, Buy Two get Three and other countless attractive offers. Online shopping with credit option and discount offer is a boom, lures us keep buying. Festive and wedding shopping is a gala affair for us. Even the wealthy do not mind going to abroad just to enjoy an exotic meal crafted by a world-renowned chef. In today’s world, Power of temptation and enticement determines or influences our spending decisions rather than actual needs. It is important to understand here that our own consumption habits and behaviours are the cornerstones of all the sustainability livings that we are talking about today. Though the most straightforward approach for sustainable living is to make our lifestyle choices based on our needs. Friends, here is the golden quote of our father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. “The world has enough for everyone’s needs, but not everyone’s greed,” The greatest wealth in life is being content with just minimum things. [ The Speaking Tree] My phone rang! Call from the Conference Event organizer. With an invisible smile on my face, I eagerly lifted the call. However, the news he delivered is far from what I expected. He informed me that the conference event had been cancelled as the main corporate sponsor of the event backed out at the last minute. Their Head office has put a hold on all their marketing and promotional budget with immediate effect. ‘Since it is very big event, arranging an alternative sponsor at such short notice is not possible,’ he said. Of course, he was remorseful about the cancellation of the event and felt extremely sorry about this unfortunate turn of events. After hearing the devastating news from him, I could not think properly but took a deep breath and sit silently to process the information. Although I was able to pretend that nothing happened on the call, the truth is that his call deeply hurt and shocked me. I am totally upside down. Getting the chance to be a keynote speaker gives the opportunity to be a leader and, in turn, to earn respect and influence. If in no time, just a phone call takes away, it hurts, it pains. The reality is, I am unable to digest and absorb the shock, and follow the path of increasingly belligerent. Behaving as if someone had stolen something invaluable. And believes there is a conspiracy. I am trying my best to say that whatever has happened, has happened, and I want to forget about it. After all, they have already expressed regret and apologized. What more can we expect? But mind’s counterpoint is, do not solely rely on the word “sorry,” people may use it as a tactic to escape from their accountability and responsibilities. It says it is not a money thing. Opportunity to win respect and influence are rare and difficult to come. Losing one is simply not acceptable, whatsoever the reason. Also argues that the entire world is craving for the leadership position, but this phone call shattered the dream. So, no excuse. Although, I strive to get rid of this situation, but feel powerless to stop the questions of my own mind. No matter how hard I try to pull myself summoning all my strength- just to let it go, but the belligerent mind refuses to budge. Finally, I could not find a better way to console myself than to say: “Never Mind, Apna Time Aayega.” Remember, a bit of humor to the belligerent mind works wonder. Thank you. Last but certainly not least, majority of our elderly parents, like my mother, continue to perform their day-to-day routines’ despite of physical challenges or injuries, of course with enduring pain. Let us take a moment to salute their unwavering determination and perseverance!",https://anecdotebox.com/how-did-we-get-1m-visitors-in-30-days-without-anything/,1218
Stories,The Nine days,"October 5, 2025 at 3:03 am","In most religions, the path to the divine demand fasting. But what does true fasting really mean? Is it simply keeping the stomach empty, or is it something deeper—within the mind? This profound truth","inspirational, reflective, emotional, nostalgic, spiritual","In most religions, the path to the divine demand fasting. But what does true fasting really mean? Is it simply keeping the stomach empty, or is it something deeper—within the mind? This profound truth unfolded for me during this year’s Navratri: fasting is not about when you stop eating, it is about when you start paying attention. While the stomach can be forced to obey, the mind demands conviction. I’ve observed Navratri fasts for years, always with sincerity, though not with strict adherence. This year, nudged by my wife’s casual remark that I hadn’t been observing the rituals correctly, I resolved to follow every day’s ritual strictly, with no shortcuts. I made divine promise — Any violation would mean an extra day of fasting as penance. A few days before Navratri, I browsed social media for fasting recipes. Some looked more lavish than my usual meals. It felt like those recipe reels were made to generate more cravings than fasting. I shortlisted nine dishes, made a shopping list, and planned everything carefully. Everything seemed perfect—at least on paper. Day One Navratri 2025 began with enthusiasm. Rajgira rotis were on the menu for the first day. However, as I began making the dough, reality set in quickly. The rotis wouldn’t roll. They stuck, tore, and looked like maps of some unknown countries. Not even one turned out right. Frustration set in, followed by disappointment and anger. The kitchen felt like a battlefield I was losing. But amid the mess, a quiet realisation emerged: perhaps the real hunger wasn’t in my stomach, but in my restless mind. That’s when I understood—true fasting begins in the mind. It is the practice of training oneself to be calm, focused, and free from restlessness. On the second day, I learned to be kinder to myself when the Sabu dana khichri recipe became sticky. My first instinct was self-criticism. But then I paused. If I could forgive others for their small mistakes, why not extend the same compassion to myself? Day Three taught me silence. A colleague’s comment stung during the office virtual meeting. I chose restraint over reaction. Sometimes silence means not weakness; it means strength held gently. On Day Four, lost in a heated office call, the samak rice khichdi burnt completely. I laughed at the absurdity and simply began again. In utter setback, I found the courage to restart. On the fifth day, as I was returning from a nearby Durga Puja pandal, a beggar approached me. I had no cash. But instead of turning him away, I took him to a roadside eatery and paid for a meal through UPI. Happiness amplifies when shared. Day Six became a lesson in patience. Stuck in traffic after a draining global work call, every red light tested my patience. Patience isn’t about liking delays—it’s about not letting them disturb your inner stillness. Day Seven was our company’s year-end party at a five-star hotel, full of lights, music, and celebration. I wanted to join in, but I decided to stick to my commitment. On Day Eight, I learned about surrendering in a way I didn’t expect. I had planned an evening puja at home, and everything was ready. But just before the aarti, the power went out and the house was dark. My plan fell apart. Then without thinking, I lit extra diyas. I realized that surrender isn’t about giving up, but about letting go of control. By the ninth day, the mind had settled into a calm rhythm. The fast no longer felt like a set of rigid rules. Everything felt like absolute freedom. I realised that devotion is a relationship, not a transaction. Day 10 – Dussehra The final day arrived to break my fast. There was absolute clarity in my mind. I sat quietly, reflecting on these nine days, every dietary rule, every struggle, every quiet victory. Then, unexpectedly, a memory from Day Eight surfaced. The last two days eighth and ninth were meant to be fruits only—no sweets, no grains. But that evening, while visiting the Durga Puja pandal with colleagues, I had casually eaten a Bengali sweet when a colleague offered it to me. At that moment, I hadn’t even thought about the restriction. It was a small slip, but a violation, nonetheless. And according to my own divine promise, any violation meant an additional day of fasting. The question was clear: Should I break the fast today or extend. For a moment, the answer seemed obvious. Yes, I should honour. It felt right, almost necessary. But then my phone rang. It was my brother. I knew immediately—my mother wanted to hear that her son had finally eaten after nine days. For a humble, aging mother, divine promises don’t matter. What matters is simple and powerful—has her child eaten? Is he well? I froze. How could I tell her I planned to extend the fast over a breach she wouldn’t understand? She would be heartbroken. Caught between two truths—one to the divine, demanding perfection, the other to my mother, waiting with love—I realised lying would nullify everything. I followed my heart. Before she could speak, I said gently, “Ma, I’m just going to eat now.” The divine promise could wait a day—because Ekadasi was the very next day, and I would honour it then. Durga Puja, Vashi, Navi Mumbai Fasting is the first lesson in self-discipline. It isn’t about what we deny ourselves, but what we discover within. Thank you. Happy reading.

In today’s digital world, everyone floods us with information — as if they’re helping. But often, they’re just emptying our time. We all have a finite number of hours. Once they’re gone, they’re gone. No refunds. No replays. Yet we guard our money fiercely while letting strangers, algorithms, and apps drain our most precious resource. The biggest trap of the 21st century isn’t losing money — it’s losing time. Everyone Claims They’re Helping — But They’re Taking Look around: Social media promises connection but delivers distraction. News claims to inform but fuels anxiety. Productivity hacks take hours to implement. Work culture disguises availability as commitment. After consuming all this, do you feel richer or emptier? Information overload isn’t education — it’s evacuation: of focus, peace, and life. Time Bankruptcy — The New Poverty We obsess over financial wealth while ignoring time poverty. When money’s stolen, we notice. When time’s stolen, we don’t — until years later, when we ask, “Where did my life go?” Big Tech doesn’t want your cash — it wants your hours. Hours become attention. Attention becomes data. Data becomes money — their money, your time. Lock your attention like you lock your home. Try this: Delete what doesn’t serve you. Turn off non-essential notifications. Schedule device-free hours like meetings. Make your phone boring (try grayscale). Say no without guilt. Your availability is not your value. Creation Over Consumption Time Sovereignty — The Real Wealth The wealthy of tomorrow won’t be those with more money — but with more time sovereignty. Time sovereignty means protecting your hours like you protect what you love. It means thinking deeply instead of reacting constantly. It means valuing presence over productivity.
